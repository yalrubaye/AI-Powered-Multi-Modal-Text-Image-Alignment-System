# AI-Powered-Multi-Modal-Text-Image-Alignment-System

Technologies: Python | PyTorch  

This project is a deep learning system that matches images and text based on how similar they are. It was built using PyTorch and trained on the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits). The model learns to understand both images and their matching text descriptions by putting them in the same kind of space.
